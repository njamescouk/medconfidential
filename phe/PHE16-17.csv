This connectivity map process has been implemented and has identified 10 prescription medications (used for non-cancer purposes) that potentially reduce or increase breast cancer risk. The aim of this study is to determine the association between the 10 identified medications (from connectivity mapping) and breast cancer risk.  The study could identify (previously unrecognised) medications which increase the risk of breast cancer development; current licensing and use of such medications may need to be reconsidered. This study also has the potential to identify licensed medications that reduce breast cancer risk and warrant further study in clinical trials.
