- Low awareness of cancer symptoms in the general population and among general practitioners

- Delay in referral and diagnosis in primary and/or secondary care 
- Comorbidity precluding effective treatment 
- Sub-optimal treatment of cancer patients 

To strengthen the current evidence, we propose to study the entire clinical pathway of cancer patients: from symptomatic presentation in primary care, to diagnostic investigations and specialist referrals, to cancer treatment and patient management after diagnosis.

In 1996-2001, 1.3 million women, aged 50-64, who had been invited for breast cancer screening at centres throughout England and Scotland, were recruited into the study. All women completed a recruitment questionnaire on hormonal, anthropometric, and other personal characteristics and attended at least one routine mammographic screen which took place at recruitment into the study. The cohort has been re-surveyed at approximately 3 yearly intervals since recruitment to update information on various factors (see http://www.millionwomenstudy.org.uk for further details of the study and questionnaires). 

All participants have been flagged on the NHS central registers for incident cancer, yielding data on cancer site (coded according to ICD-10) and morphology (coded according to ICD-O). Although it has been shown that cancer diagnosis can be adequately determined from the information routinely collected in NHS central registers, linkage with the cancer registry data would afford the important benefit of a more tumour specific data on each incident case. Through data linkage to cancer registration data, the study aims to describe the relationship between reproductive, hormonal, genetic and lifestyle factors and the risk of cancers at specific sites according to key tumour characteristics. This research should not only provide information on which risk factors are associated with specific cancer subtypes but may also clarify some of the biological mechanisms underlying these associations.","National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service","Personally identifiable","Consent",2014-08-08

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the UK and although this is associated with an 85% 5 year survival rate there were still 11,500 attributable deaths in 2012. Past research has suggested that patients with RA may have lesser occurrence of breast cancer compared to those without RA.
Our own analysis of the BSRBR-RA dataset has also identified a trend towards lesser breast cancer in patients receiving TNF inhibitors which suggests that this association may relate to inflammation or another related factor.

NABCOP was commissioned by the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP) as part of the National Clinical Audit Patient Outcomes Programme in response to the need for better information about the quality of breast cancer services and care provided in England and Wales. This audit aims to evaluate the processes of care and outcomes of women aged 70 years and older with a histological diagnosis of breast cancer and who are treated within England and Wales. The patterns of care observed in these women will be compared with those observed among women diagnosed with breast cancer aged 50-69 years.","National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service","Personally identifiable","Regulation 5",2017-06-26
