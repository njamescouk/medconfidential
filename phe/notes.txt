export each sheet of PHE data release registers - public review.ods 
to PHE14-15.csv PHE15-16.csv PHE16-17.csv PHE17-18.csv by hand

clear out some of obvious tripe

dates all over the place, edited ss and saved sheets as csv
ran clean.bat, still problems

manually format dates in ss, save copy as to csv files, then clean.db

we have a table in a db

starting commentary

creating summary pages via views

stalled with legal bases, keying phe table

done?
