In 1996-2001, 1.3 million women, aged 50-64, who had been invited for breast cancer screening at centres throughout England and Scotland, were recruited into the study. All women completed a recruitment questionnaire on hormonal, anthropometric, and other personal characteristics and attended at least one routine mammographic screen which took place at recruitment into the study. The cohort has been re-surveyed at approximately 3 yearly intervals since recruitment to update information on various factors (see http://www.millionwomenstudy.org.uk for further details of the study and questionnaires). 

All participants have been flagged on the NHS central registers for incident cancer, yielding data on cancer site (coded according to ICD-10) and morphology (coded according to ICD-O). Although it has been shown that cancer diagnosis can be adequately determined from the information routinely collected in NHS central registers, linkage with the cancer registry data would afford the important benefit of a more tumour specific data on each incident case. Through data linkage to cancer registration data, the study aims to describe the relationship between reproductive, hormonal, genetic and lifestyle factors and the risk of cancers at specific sites according to key tumour characteristics. This research should not only provide information on which risk factors are associated with specific cancer subtypes but may also clarify some of the biological mechanisms underlying these associations.","National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service","Personally identifiable","Consent",2014-08-08

- Low awareness of cancer symptoms in the general population and among general practitioners 
- Barriers to symptomatic presentation 
- Delay in referral and diagnosis in primary and/or secondary care 
- Comorbidity precluding effective treatment 
- Sub-optimal treatment of cancer patients 

To strengthen the current evidence, we propose to study the entire clinical pathway of cancer patients: from symptomatic presentation in primary care, to diagnostic investigations and specialist referrals, to cancer treatment and patient management after diagnosis. This will be achieved using an up-to-date linkage between existing datasets containing detailed information on the cancer, its management and treatment, and on the primary care events occurring before and after the cancer diagnosis","National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service","Personally identifiable","Regulation 5 (s251)",2015-03-20

An intensive treatment pathway will be followed by younger/fitter patients where intensive HDT with stem cell support is considered appropriate, whilst older/less fit patients will proceed through the non?intensive pathway. Both pathways comprise induction, consolidation and maintenance components.
The trial aims to answer three main questions: at induction, consolidation and maintenance:-
1. Is cyclophosphamide-lenalidomide-dexamethasone (RCD) or a 4-drug regimen including both lenalidomide and carfilzomib (CCRD) given to maximum response, a better induction regimen than the current UK gold standard of cyclophosphamide-thalidomide-dexamethasone (CTD)?
2. For patients achieving a sub optimal response to induction across both treatment pathways (<VGPR), can the use of bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (VCD) improve responses and does this translate into improved PFS and OS?
3. Can lenalidomide or lenalidomide with vorinostat at maintenance improve PFS and OS when compared to the use of no maintenance?","National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service","Personally identifiable","Consent",2015-03-20
