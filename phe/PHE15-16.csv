An established review process will ensure that uniform Gleason grading and quantitative analysis of the biopsy samples can be made. Corresponding tissue blocks will be requested for further immunohistochemical and molecular marker analysis.

Past research has suggested that patients with RA may have lesser occurrence of breast cancer compared to those without RA.
Our own analysis of the BSRBR-RA dataset has also identified a trend towards lesser breast cancer in patients receiving TNF inhibitors which suggests that this association may relate to inflammation or another related factor.

It will aim to explain the extent to which differences may be attributable to differences in definition, type or stage of disease at diagnosis, or in clinical investigation or treatment, or the effectiveness of health care systems. It will aim to provide evidence to support health policy. 

By 2014, CONCORD-2 will start to provide regular information on world-wide survival trends among cancer patients diagnosed between 1990 and 2009 or later.

The aims of CONCORD-2 are: 

? To provide quantitative and directly comparable estimates of cancer survival in many countries world-wide, for 10 malignancies that are common in adults, and childhood leukaemia, using individual data from population-based cancer registries, supplied to agreed standards and analysed centrally;

 ? To document world-wide trends in cancer survival since 1995 as the basis for systematic global surveillance of cancer survival, to enable examination of the underlying causes of survival differences, and to derive measures such as the population ?cure? fraction, cancer prevalence and the number of avoidable premature deaths as a basis for informing national and global policy for cancer control.
